## git is a good place to store code, but terrible place to store data
## do not store data more than 100mb


## to ignore folder in git -> gitignore, type file names or folder names (ex: Inputs/ Outputs/)

## saving on the local repository
## commit the change and push it to the github (control A to select all files, and hit stage to add all the files at the same time)
   ## add commit message to keep tracking different version (ex: adding or deleting the code; more detail the commit message, the better)
## from github, pull the data to local repository
